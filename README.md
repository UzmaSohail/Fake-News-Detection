# Fake News Detection

In this digital age, fake news is a huge issue considering it hurts real-world communities by diseminating misinformation and igniting social unrest.
hence, a technique to determine fake news by applying methods based on NLP helps in identifying fake-news in real time.
## Machine Learning algorithms used:
Machine Learning algorithms like **Logistic Regression**,**Decision TreeClassifier**,**Passive Aggressive Classifier** and **Random Forest Classifier** can determine whether an article is legitemate or fraudulent by examining the language issues.
### Logistic Regression:
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. The model delivers a binary or dichotomous outcome limited to two possible outcomes: yes/no, 0/1, or true/false.
### Decision Tree Classifier:
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes).
### Random Forest Classifier:
Random Forest is a widely-used machine learning algorithm developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.
### Passive Aggressive Classifier:
Passive Aggressive (PA) classifiers are a type of online learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks. They are based on the idea of being “passive” when the current model correctly classifies a training example, but “aggressive” when it makes a mistake.
## Python libraries to be used:
Additionally, different python libraries like **Numpy**, **Pandas** and **Seaborn** can be used.
